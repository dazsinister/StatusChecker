This is a status checker that I have been working on. The main code was written by someone else and my code surrounding it. So far it seems to work well minus
no loop function which I'm currently working on resolving. 

The main idea behind it is it signs into a website and checks your order status. When your order status changes it will email you using Gmail services.
